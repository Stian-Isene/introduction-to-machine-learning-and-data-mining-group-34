# Tasks for the report

## Lecture 1 - A description of your data set

### Explain what your data is about. I.e. what is the overall problem of interest?

### Provide a reference to where you obtained the data

### Summarize previous analysis of the data. (i.e. go through one or two of the original source papers and read what they did to the data and summarize their results).

### You will be asked to apply (1) classification and (2) regression on your data in the next report. For now, we want you to consider how this should be done. Therefore:

#### Explain, in the context of your problem of interest, what you hope to accomplish/learn from the data using these techniques?.
#### Explain which attribute you wish to predict in the regression based on which other attributes? Which class label will you predict based on which other attributes in the classification task?
#### If you need to transform the data in order to carry out these tasks, explain roughly how you plan to do this.


## Lecture 2
### A detailed explanation of the attributes of the data.
#### Describe if the attributes are discrete/continuous, Nominal/Ordinal/Interval/Ratio

#### Give an accountof whether there are data issues (ie missing values or corrupted data) and describe them if so.

### Tasks from PCA section
#### The amount of variation explained as a function of the number of PCA components included.

#### the principal directions of the considered PCA components (either find a way to plot them or interpret them in terms of the features)

#### the data projected onto the considered principal components
